# Assignment 2

1. 		Write a program that reads a string and outputs the number of times each lowercase vowel
	appears in it. Your program must contain a function with one of its parameters as a string
	variable, and return the number of times each lowercase vowel appears in it. Also write a
	program to test your function.


2. 		The cost to become a member of a fitness center is as follows: (a) Senior citizens discount
	is 30%, (b) If membership is bought and paid for 12 or more months, the discount is 15%,
	(c) If more than five personal training sessions are bought and paid for, the discount on
	each session is 20%. Write a program that determines the cost of a new membership. Your
	program must contain a function that displays the general information about the fitness
	center and its charges; a function to get all of the necessary information to determine the
	membership cost; and a function to determine the membership cost. Use appropriate
	parameters to pass information in and out of a function. (Do not use any global variables.)

3. 		Write a program to convert the time from 24-hour notation to 12-hour notation and vice
	versa. Your program must be menu driven, giving the user the choice of converting the
	time between the two notations. Furthermore, your program must contain at least the
	following function: a function to convert the time from 24-hour notation to 12-hour
	notation, a function to convert the time from 12-hour notation to 24-hour notation, a
	function to display the choices, function(s) to get the input, and function(s) to display the
	results. (For 12-hour time notation, your program must display AM or PM.)
